Citing REFPROP
**************

The following reference can be used to cite the REFPROP program in publications:

    Lemmon, E.W., Bell, I.H., Huber, M.L., McLinden, M.O.  NIST Standard Reference Database 23:  Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties-REFPROP, Version 10.0, National Institute of Standards and Technology, Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersburg, 2018.

Or in BibTeX form::

    @Misc{LEMMON-RP10,
      Title            = {{NIST Standard Reference Database 23: Reference Fluid Thermodynamic and Transport Properties-REFPROP, Version 10.0, National Institute of Standards and Technology}},
      Author           = {E. W. Lemmon and I. H. Bell and M. L. Huber and M. O. McLinden},
      Year             = {2018},
      Doi              = {https://doi.org/10.18434/T4/1502528},
      Url              = {https://www.nist.gov/srd/refprop}
    }

Additionally, users should cite the reference for either the equation of state or the transport equations used in their work, for example, if you used calculations for carbon dioxoide, you will find the reference for the equation of state under the ``Options/Fluid`` Information option in the REFPROP GUI and you should cite the reference given under that option, like this:

    Span, R. and Wagner, W., *J. Phys. Chem. Ref. Data*, 25(6):1509-1596, 1996.
