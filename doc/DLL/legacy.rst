Function Documentation
----------------------
.. f:subroutine:: ABFL1dll (a, b, z, kph, ab, Dmin, Dmax, T, P, D, ierr, herr, ab_length, herr_length)

    
    General single-phase flash routine given two inputs and composition.
    Valid input properties are temperature, pressure, density, energy,
    enthalpy, or entropy.  The character string ab specifies the inputs,
    which can be T, P, D, E, H, S.  An input of 'EH' (or 'HE') is
    not supported.  The letters in this string must be uppercase.
    
    Care must be taken when sending inputs of T, P, or D, so that the same
    variable is not sent twice.   For example, the following would be wrong::
        call ABFL1 ('TH',T,H,z,kph,0,0,Dmin,Dmax,T,P,D,ierr,herr)
    
    Rather, the following are examples of correct inputs::
        call ABFL1 ('TH',T,H,z,kph,0,Dmin,Dmax,tt,P, D,ierr,herr)
        call ABFL1 ('TP',T,P,z,kph,0,Dmin,Dmax,tt,pp,D,ierr,herr)
        call ABFL1 ('DS',D,S,z,kph,0,Dmin,Dmax,T, P,dd,ierr,herr)
    
    When calling the ABFL1dll routine, the inputs are different::
        call ABFL1dll (a,b,z,kph,ab,Dmin,Dmax,T,P,D,ierr,herr)
    
    The examples above are repeated below for this call::
        call ABFL1dll (T,H,z,kph,'TH',Dmin,Dmax,tt,P, D,ierr,herr)
        call ABFL1dll (T,P,z,kph,'TP',Dmin,Dmax,tt,pp,D,ierr,herr)
        call ABFL1dll (D,S,z,kph,'DS',Dmin,Dmax,T, P,dd,ierr,herr)
    
    This routine accepts only single-phase inputs, it is intended primarily
    for use with the more general flash routine ABFLSH, but can be called
    independently for increased calculation speed if the inputs are
    known to be single-phase.  This will avoid the call to the flash routines
    to determine the phase of the inputs.  If this routine is called, but
    the inputs are 2-phase, either an incorrect root or a metastable state
    will be returned (which is OK if the metastable state is desired).
    
    However!  This routine is not necessary because all flash calls can be made
    through a call to ABFLSH or ABFLSHdll.  It is recommended to use either
    the REFPROP or ABFLSH routines for all flash calculations even for single
    phase calls when it is not necessary to check the phase of the input
    properties.  For example, the TH call above for a known liquid phase state
    could be called like this::
    
       iFlag=10  !Indicates that the input state is in the liquid.
                 !Use iFlag=20 for vapor phase states.
       call ABFLSHdll ('TH',T,H,z,iFlag,tt,P,D,Dl,Dv,
      &                   x,y,q,e,hh,s,Cv,Cp,w,ierr,herr)
    
    Further information is given in the comments under the ABFLSH and REFPROP
    subroutines.

.. f:subroutine:: ABFL2dll (a, b, z, kq, ksat, ab, Tbub, Tdew, Pbub, Pdew, Dlbub, Dvdew, ybub, xdew, T, P, Dl, Dv, x, y, q, ierr, herr, ab_length, herr_length)

    
    General flash calculation given two inputs and composition.  Valid
    properties for the first input are temperature, pressure, and density.
    Valid properties for the second are pressure, density, energy, enthalpy,
    entropy, or quality.  The character string ab specifies the inputs.
    
    This routine accepts only two-phase states as inputs; it is intended
    primarily for use by the general flash routines such as THFLSH or
    TSFLSH.  It may be called independently if the state is known to be
    two-phase.  But beware - this routine does not check limits, and it
    will be significantly faster than TSFLSH, etc., when the bubble
    and dew point limits can be provided (ksat=1 option).
    
    This routine calls TPFL2 within a secant-method iteration to find
    a solution.  Initial guesses are based on the liquid density
    at the bubble point and the vapor density at the dew point.

    :p double Pdew [in]: Dew point pressure [kPa] at (T and y=z) For either case
    :p double Dlbub [in]: Liquid density [mol/L] at bubble point

    ends at a saturated liquid state very close to the critical point.
    The argument z in this routine is an array with the mole fractions
    of the mixture.  If the input T is non-zero, it is used as the
    initial guess.

.. f:subroutine:: CRITPdll (z, Tc, Pc, Dc, ierr, herr, herr_length)

    
    Calculate critical parameters as a function of composition.
    The critical parameters are estimates based on polynomial
    fits to the binary critical lines.  For 3 or more components,
    combining rules are applied to the constituent binaries.
    
    If SATSPLN has been called and the input composition sent here is the
    same as that sent to SATSPLN, the values calculated from the splines
    are returned, which are nearly exact.  During the call to SATSPLN,
    the true critical point, maximum pressure point, and maximum
    temperature point along the saturation lines are determined.
    Without the splines and for a system with three or more components,
    the values from this routine are only rough estimates.

    Subroutine for the determination of the true critical point of a
    mixture with the use of the method of Michelsen (1984).
    
    The routine requires good initial guess values of Pc and Tc.
    
    On convergence, the values of bb and cc should be close to zero
    and dd > 0 for a two-phase critical point.
    bb=0, cc=0, and dd <= 0 for an unstable critical point.

    The order of icomp and jcomp do not matter, the routine returns the
    parameters as stored in the HMX.BNC file.  To determine if the
    compositions are backwards, call HMXORDER.  If calling SETMIX with
    the same parameters, an error will be returned if the components
    are backwards.

    Returns limits of a property model as a function of composition
    and/or checks inputs T, D, and P against those limits.
    
    Pure fluid limits are read in from the *.fld files; for mixtures, a
    simple mole fraction weighting of the reduced variables is used.
    
    Attempting calculations below the minimum temperature and/or above
    the maximum density may result in an error.  These will often
    correspond to a physically unreasonable state; also many equations of
    state do not extrapolate reliably to lower T's and higher D's.
    
    A warning is issued if the temperature is above the maximum but below
    1.5 times the maximum.  Pressures up to twice the maximum
    result in only a warning.  Most equations of state may be
    extrapolated to higher T's and P's.  Temperatures and/or pressures
    outside these extended limits will result in an error.
    
    When calling with an unknown temperature, set T to -1 to avoid performing
    the melting line check.  If inputs are not available, use T=300, P=0, and D=0.
    
    If multiple inputs are outside limits, ierr=SUM(ABS(ierr)),
    with a positive sign if any error greater than zero (calculations not

    gas part is calculated in terms of absolute temperature and
    density.  (This distinction is necessary for mixtures.)
